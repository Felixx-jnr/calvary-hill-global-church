      "DIVINE LEADINGS, GRACE FOR SOUL WINNING AND THE HEALING POWER OF GOD THROUGH ME",
    content:
      "Good evening, Dad. I thank God for the month of August. I saw God's leading, particularly in my exam. I'm so grateful for the daily devotionals, especially that God led me from the inward witness primarily. It drove the consciousness into me, and I was always conscious that I was led. I just knew where to read for my exams. And after the exams, my two course mates I studied with came to hug me and thank me and this was one of my best results. I also thank God for the teachings on soul winning this month. I was really spurred to preach, though I didn't find anyone who was sick. I kept searching for an opportunity. Then, a course mate of mine came to my room with indigestion. I prayed for her; at first, it was still the same. Then, I asked what she really wanted to do, and she said she just wanted to belch and feel relief. Then, we prayed again, and she belched. I told her she would feel better tomorrow, and she did the next day. Glory! Thank you so much, Dad I'm grateful for all the teachings and for the prophetic words of the month, my month of His mercy in leadings and healing",

    title: "HEALING AND RELIEF FROM JAW PAIN",
    content:
      "Good morning Dad,I want to thank God for yet another great thing I have experienced as result of being in this great family, and under my spiritual Father. I have had some discomfort in my jaw for many years because of an injury. I was told to manage it and live with it except I was willing to have surgery which cost a lot. On one of the Wednesday's in the month, Dad gave words about someone with a jaw pain. I immediately knew it was me because I usually wouldn't have wanted to believe God for it. But in that teaching, I learnt no matter how small the issue may be or how long it has lasted, God was still willing and able to heal. I started praying about it and the word came in that  meeting. I received the prayers and the anointing from Dad and I received my healing. That same day I saw symptoms subside greatly. Thank you so much Dad for the teachings that makes us stronger. I'm forever grateful!",

    title: "HEALING AND REDUCTION IN GROWTH ON THE THROAT",
    content:
      "Good afternoon Dad, In the month of August, I received my healing on two different occasions during the Wednesday mid week service and I also believed for healing for a family member of mine. During the first series on Few things to know about healing, I was down with malaria and the teaching was just so timely because my sister also had a growth on her neck that I didn't know about. But Dad released words during the meeting about an outgrowth and that the Doctors report will change. I took the words down without knowing that the words applied to me after the meeting I realized my sister went to the hospital earlier in the day and that she was to go for surgery to take out whatever was growing on her neck. It was at that time I remembered the word. I told her about it and even showed her were I had written it down. I stayed in faith for her and weeks after, she told me that the outgrowth had reduced.Meanwhile, the malaria symptoms I felt were all gone without taking any pills. Two weeks later when Dad was teaching on 2nd series, the symptoms came back and this time, it was worse. I had a very bad headache and body pain to the end that I couldn't even stream service online comfortably and I slept off mid way. At the end of service, Dad released words for healing and the devil brought condemnation and doubt that I wouldn't receive my healing because I didn't stream service all through. The next day, I wasn't feeling any better and my mum even convinced me to take drugs for the pain but I refused believing that I could still receive my healing. After some days, my catarrh seized and this happened without drugs. Dad will always tell us he has an anointing for healing and this has really helped me receive. Indeed the meeting you miss is the meeting you need. Thank you so much Dad. I'm forever blessed. ",

      "HEALING  & MANIFESTATION OF IMPARTATION FOR HEALING RECEIVED DURING SERVICE",
    content:
      "The month of August was the month Dad started teaching about healing on Wednesday meeting and I remember coming to the FEW Important things to Know about Healing.  I came very expectant with the desire but more specifically, expectant to receive greater impartations for healings just simply by attending the meeting even if Dad didn't lay hands on me. Two testimonies happened as a result of this service in particular. The first one was that Dad prayed for my family members and as Dad was praying, he prayed regarding every recurring sickness in my blood line and that more specifically, I'm delivered from any sickness the devil might want to put on me and that I'll not need glasses and my eyes see clearly. This was so specific and I knew God had just delivered me from a sickness even before it happened because apparently, everyone in my nuclear and almost everyone in my extended family from both my mum and Daddy's side all use glasses. So, it seemed so normal so when Dad mentioned my eyes see clearly, immediately I knew a deliverance had happened. Secondly, a little back story to this is that I had seen myself come into a healing grace as I started following Dad's ministry. I began to see myself while in school till date have dreams about people getting healed several times. I saw myself come into it more this year in particular but for this Wednesday service, I came expectant for more of the manifestations and so, later that same week on Friday night,  I dreamt of Dad teaching us about healing again somewhere and me practicing it as Dad instructed in the dream. I remember the person getting healed in the dream but I didn't really understand what it meant. So, the next day was general evangelism and as I went, I met someone who I preached to, got saved and then I got he had a pain, I  asked him where and he said he waist and I got to ask him how long  it had been for and he said for 4 years. So, I just trusted in the power of God, conscious of the more healing grace I had received on Wednesday and made him understand he will receive his healing and stirred his faith. So, knowing I had received a greater impartation and trusting the power of God, I laid hands and after I was done, he said the pain had gone. I had to tell him please be very honest. If it isn't totally gone, tell me. I can lay hands again but don't lie please. But he said it had all gone. Honestly, I knew this was once again the healing grace upon Dad rubbing off me and I was more shocked because it left instantly without me laying hands multiple times like I'll usually do even for headache. I'm always still in awe of God's mighty power and how simply following Dad has made me come into so much including the supernatural. I'm so grateful to God for joining me to Dad's ministry. And to think this is just the beginning! GLORY TO GOD.Thank you so much Dad for the sound teachings, impartations and the trainings. I'll forever be grateful Sir",

    title: "HEALING FROM A SKIN IRRITATION",
    content:
      "Good morning Dad, I've come to share a testimony of how i was miraculously healed in the first week of August during the Wednesday service where you taught on 'A few things to know about Healing' Sir, prior to that meeting, I was having a skin irritation...  Some parts of my face were very dry and scaly.I had tried to treat with various facial creams but it was only getting worse and I was beginning to get concerned.That Wednesday when the service prayers were being led. I was stirred to believe that I'll receive my healing during the service. Then I told God 'Lord please let Dad minister or pray for a person with a skin problem to confirm this to me' ... At the end of the service as Dad was calling out cases and declaring Healing I was expectant that my case will be called. Lo and behold, Dad mentioned it. At that point, I said a very loud Amen and I knew that that was it. Two days later, i observed my skin. The Same place that was dry and scaly was as smooth as a babies and has been ever since. I am so happy and grateful to God. His healing power is indeed real. Thank you so much Dad, i am grateful sir for the Healing and teaching anointing upon you sir. Thank you for saying Yes to the Lord and teaching us how to draw from the anointing and receive our healing. Thank you sir.",

    title: "HEALING, DELIVERANCE AND PROVISION",
    content:
      "This morning, on my way to work, I was delivered from a car accident. While I was driving to work with the bolt driver, in a bid to avoid hitting the car that suddenly came in front of us, he turned into the kerbs and climbed over the gutter on top of the thing that separates the two lanes. It all happened in a spilt second and I thought about it that because he was moving very fast, if he had hit the man that was in front of us, it would have been much worse, but thankfully, nothing happened to the driver and nothing happened to me as well. It was just the driver's front tyre that got damaged. Again, two weeks ago, in September, I was delivered from a gas explosion in my house. While cooking, shortly after I had put the food to cook, I started smelling smoke from my room and it wasn't smoke like the food was burning but it was smoke like somewhere was on fire. I quickly got to the kitchen and found that my burner was on fire. And even after I turned off the gas, the fire was still there. I eventually blew it and it went off and I just thought to myself that if I had stepped out like I would sometimes do for a few minutes or if I had waited a little longer in my room and the fire got to the back of the burner where the gas pipe that connects the gas from the cylinder outside was, there would have been an explosion. I'm so grateful to God for deliverance and I'm so grateful to Dad for the covering and the declarations of protection over us every time. I know that those words and prayers are working and that's why I experienced the deliverance on these two occasions. I'm so grateful Dad. Provision I'm also very grateful for the teachings that Dad has been teaching us to walk in faith for our finances. Last month, I saw my faith work so much in this aspect as I exercised my faith by sending forth angels and claiming the amount I wanted as Dad has taught us to do. On the first occasion, I got the exact amount I called forth two days later. The second time, it took longer, but the money eventually came and it was so much more than what I called forth. And it stirred me much more to walk in faith for my finances. Healing The last testimony was in the month of August when Dad was teaching on Few Important things to know about healing. In the course of the first teaching, Dad mentioned exactly what had happened to me. Dad said that you might be having symptoms but the doctor said it's gone, that that's a confirmation of your healing and that the symptoms will eventually subside. Immediately I heard that, I received that word because just two days before that, I went to the hospital and ran a test and the test result showed that I no longer had ulcer. I was happy about it, but I was a bit confused because I was still seeing the symptoms. Hearing what Dad said in that service cleared up my confusion and confirmed to me that I was indeed healed and within that same month, almost all of the symptoms, with the major ones being bloating whenever I ate and the stomach pain when I did not eat have all subsided. I know I've been healed totally and I'm so grateful for meetings and the grace of God upon Dad's life in meetings where I get to always receive even in ways I did not expect. Thank you so much Dad for your grace that I have become a constant partaker of. Thank you so much Sir for teaching me to walk in faith and for being an example of walking in faith by the many results that your faith has produced Sir. I'm very grateful Sir. Thank you so much Dad",
